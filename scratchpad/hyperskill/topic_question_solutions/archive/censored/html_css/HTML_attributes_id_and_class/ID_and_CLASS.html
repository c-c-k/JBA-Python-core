        <p class="italic">Autumn is often called golden and it is easy to guess why: leaves on trees change their color from green to different shades of yellow. It is impossible to cover all the variety of these colors: red copper, yellow ochre, brownish bronze, pale and orange gold.  These colors always remind us of autumn.</p>
