----- QUESTIONS -----
These exercises are meant to further demonstrate what sed can do.

1.  Print a list of files in your scripts directory, ending in ".sh". Mind that you might have to unalias ls. Put the result in a temporary file.
2.  Make a list of files in /usr/bin that have the letter "a" as the second character. Put the result in a temporary file.
3.  Delete the first 3 lines of each temporary file.
4.  Print to standard output only the lines containing the pattern "an".
5.  Create a file holding sed commands to perform the previous two tasks. Add an extra command to this file that adds a string like "*** This might have something to do with man and man pages ***" in the line preceding every occurence of the string "man". Check the results.
6.  A long listing of the root directory, /, is used for input. Create a file holding sed commands that check for symbolic links and plain files. If a file is a symbolic link, precede it with a line like "--This is a symlink--". If the file is a plain file, add a string on the same line, adding a comment like "<--- this is a plain file".
7.  Create a script that shows lines containing trailing white spaces from a file. This script should use a sed script and show sensible information to the user.

1.  Print a list of files in your scripts directory, ending in ".sh". Mind that you might have to unalias ls. Put the result in a temporary file.
    Answer:
	long options:
	:$  unalias ls
	:$  ls ~/bpg | sed --silent "/\.sh/p" > "/dev/shm/sed.ex1.tmp"
	:$  cat /dev/shm/sed.ex1.tmp
	short options:
	:$  unalias ls
	:$  ls ~/bpg | sed -n "/\.sh/p" > "/dev/shm/sed.ex1.tmp"
	:$  cat /dev/shm/sed.ex1.tmp

2.  Make a list of files in /usr/bin that have the letter "a" as the second character. Put the result in a temporary file.
    Answer:
	long options:
	:$  unalias ls
	:$  ls /usr/bin | sed --quiet "/^.a.*/p" > "/dev/shm/sed.ex2.tmp"
	short options:
	:$  unalias ls
	:$  ls /usr/bin | sed -n "/^.a.*/p" > "/dev/shm/sed.ex2.tmp"

3.  Delete the first 3 lines of each temporary file.
    Answer:
	long options:
	:$  sed --in-place='.backup' --separate "1,3d" /dev/shm/sed.ex?.tmp
	short options:
	:$  sed -si='.backup' "1,3d" /dev/shm/sed.ex?.tmp

4.  Print to standard output only the lines containing the pattern "an".
    Answer:
	long options:
	:$  sed --silent "/an/p" /dev/shm/sed.ex?.tmp
	short options:
	:$  sed -n "/an/p" /dev/shm/sed.ex?.tmp

5.  Create a file holding sed commands to perform the previous two tasks. Add an extra command to this file that adds a string like "*** This might have something to do with man and man pages ***" in the line preceding every occurence of the string "man". Check the results.
    Answer:
	Done, the script file is: "./s5-sed-an-man-printer.sh"

6.  A long listing of the root directory, /, is used for input. Create a file holding sed commands that check for symbolic links and plain files. If a file is a symbolic link, precede it with a line like "--This is a symlink--". If the file is a plain file, add a string on the same line, adding a comment like "<--- this is a plain file".
    Answer:
	Done, the script file is: "s5-decorate-files-and-symlinks.sh"

7.  Create a script that shows lines containing trailing white spaces from a file. This script should use a sed script and show sensible information to the user.
    Answer:
	Done, the script file is: "./s5-decorate-trailing-spaces.sh"
