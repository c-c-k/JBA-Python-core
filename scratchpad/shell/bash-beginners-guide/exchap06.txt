----- QUESTIONS -----
    These are some practical examples where awk can be useful.

    1.	For the first exercise, your input is lines in the following form:

	Username:Firstname:Lastname:Telephone number

	Make an awk script that will convert such a line to an LDAP record in this format:

	dn: uid=Username, dc=example, dc=com
	cn: Firstname Lastname
	sn: Lastname
	telephoneNumber: Telephone number

	Create a file containing a couple of test records and check.

    2.	Create a Bash script using awk and standard UNIX commands that will
	show the top three users of disk space in the /home file system (if you
	don't have the directory holding the homes on a separate partition, make
	the script for the / partition; this is present on every UNIX system).
	First, execute the commands from the command line. Then put them in a
	script. The script should create sensible output (sensible as in readable
	by the boss). If everything proves to work, have the script email its
	results to you (use for instance mail -s Disk space usage <you@your_comp> <
	result).

	If the quota daemon is running, use that information; if not, use find.

    3.	Create XML-style output from a Tab-separated list in the following form:

	Meaning very long line with a lot of description
	 
	meaning another long line
	 
	othermeaning    more longline
	 
	testmeaning     looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong line, but i mean really looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong.
	 

	The output should read:

	<row>
	<entry>Meaning</entry>
	<entry>
	very long line
	</entry>
	</row>
	<row>
	<entry>meaning</entry>
	<entry>
	long line
	</entry>
	</row>
	<row>
	<entryothermeaning</entry>
	<entry>
	more longline
	</entry>
	</row>
	<row>
	<entrytestmeaning</entry>
	<entry>
	looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong line, but i mean really looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong.
	</entry>
	</row>

	Additionally, if you know anything about XML, write a BEGIN and END script to complete the table. Or do it in HTML.

	Answer:
	    awk script :
		s6-ex1-convert-to-ldap-record.awk
	    bash script that generates test data and runs it :
		s6-ex1-convert-to-ldap-record.sh
