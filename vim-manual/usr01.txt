				About the manuals

This chapter introduces the  manuals available with vim. read this in order to 
know the conditions under which the commands are explained.

|01.1|	Two manuals
|01.2|	Vim installed
|01.3|	Using the vim tutor
|01.4|	Copyright

    Next chapter: |usr02.txt| The first steps in vim.
Table of contents: |usr_toc.txt|

==============================================================================
*01.1*	Two manuals

The Vim documentation consists of two parts:

1. The user Manual
	Task oriented explanations, from simple to complex. Reads from start to 
	end like a book.

2. The Reference manual
	Precise description of how everithing in Vim works.

The notation used in these manuals is explained here: |notation|

JUMPING AROUND

The text contains hyperlinks berween the two parts, allowing you to quickly
jump between a description of an editing task and a precise explanation of 
the commands and options used for it. Use this two commands:

	Press CTRL-] to jump to the sybject under the cursor.
	Press CTRL-O to jump back (repeat to go further back).

Many links are in vertical bars, like this : |bars|. The bars thenselves may
be hidden or invisible, see below. An option name like 'number' a command 
in double quotes like ":write" and any other word can also be used as  a link.
Try it out: move the cursor to CTRL-]  and press CTRL-] on it.

Other subjects can be found with the ":help" command, see |help.txt|.

The bars and stars are usually hidden with the conceal feature. They also 
use |hl-Ignore|, using the same color for the text as the background. You can 
make them visible with:
	:set conceallevel=0
	:hi link HelpBar Normal
	:hi link HelpStar Normal

==============================================================================
*01.2*	Vim installed

Most of the mannuals assume that Vim has been properly installed.  If you 
didn't do that yet, or if Vim doeesn't run properly (e.g., files can't be found 
or in the GUI the menus don't show up) first read the chapter on 
installation: |usr_90.txt|.
							*not-compatible*
The manuals offten assume you are using Vim with Vi-compatibility switched 
off.For most commands this doesn't matter, but sometimes it is important, 
e.g., for multi-level undo.  An easy way to make sure you are using a nice 
setup is to copy the example vimrc file. By doing this inside Vim you don't 
have to check where it's located.  How to do this depends on the system 
you are using:

Unix
	:!cp -i $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim ~/.vimrc
MS-DOS, MS-Windows, OS/2:
	:!copy $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim $VIM/_vimrc
Amiga: 
	:!copy $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim $VIM/,vimrc

If the file already exists you probably want to keep it.

If you start Vim now the 'compatible' option should be off.  You can check it 
with this command:

	:set compatible?

If it responds with "nocompatible" you are doing well.  If the responce is 
"compatible" you are in trouble.  You will have to find out why the option is 
still set.  Perhaps the file you wrote above is not found.  Use this command 
to find out:

	:scriptnames

If your file is not in the list, check it's location and name.  If it is in the 
list, there must be some other place where the 'compatible' option is switched 
back on.

For more info see |vimrc| and |compatible-default|.

	Note:
	This manual is about using Vim the normal way.  There is an 
	alternative called "evim" (easy vim). This is still Vim, but used 
	in a way that resembles a click-and-type editor like Notepad.  It always 
	stays in insert mode thus it is feels very diffrent. It is not 
	explained in the user manual, since it should be mostly self 
	explanatory.  See |evim-keys| for details.


==============================================================================
01.3	Using the Vim tutor				*tutor* *vimtutor*

Instrad of reading the text (boring!) you can use the vimtutor to learn your 
first Vim commands. This is a 30 minute tutorial that teaches the most basic 
Vim functionality hands-on.

On Unix, if Vim has been properly installed, you can start it fron the shell:

	vimtutor

On MS-Windows you can find it in the Program/Vim menu.  Or execute 
vimtutor.bat in the $VIMRUNTIME directory.

This will make a copy of the tutor file, so that you can edit it without 
the risk of damaging the original.
   There are a few translateed versions of the tutor.  To find out if yours is 
available, use the two-letter language code.  For French:

	vimtutor fr

On Unix, if you prefer using the the GUI version of Vim, use "gvimtutor" or 
"vimtutor -g" instead of "vimtutor".

For OpenVMS, if Vim has been properly installed, you can start vimtutor fron a 
VMS prompt with:

	@VIM:vimtutor

Optionally add the two-letter language code as above.


On other systems you have to do a little work:

1. Copy the tutor file. You can do this with Vim (it knows where to find it):

	vim --clean -c 'e $VIMRUNTIME/turor/tutor' -c 'w! TUTORCOPY' -c 'q'

    This will write the file "TUTORCOPY" in the current directory.  To use a 
translated version of the tutor, append the two-letter language code to the 
filename.  For French:

	vim --clean -c 'e $VIMRUNTIME/tutor/tutor.fr' -c 'W! TUTORCOPY' -c 'q'

2. Edit the copied file with Vim:

	Vim --clean TUTORCOPY

    The --clean argument makes sure Vim is started with nice defaults.

3. Delete the copied file when you are finished with it:

	del TUTORCOPY
