# What day is it?

# 6654 users solved this problem. Latest completion was about 22 hours ago.
# 
# Today the whole world uses the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to
# distinguish between the time zones. The UTC is considered to be the 0, and
# the rest of the time zones are expressed using positive or negative offsets
# from the UTC. For instance, London is in the zone UTC+00:00 (or GMT) and
# Moscow is in the zone UTC+3:00.
# 
# There are 14 positive offsets (from UTC+1:00 to UTC+14:00) and 12 negative
# offsets (from UTC-12:00 to UTC-1:00). This also means that at a particular
# hour, three calendar days are observed on the planet. For example, if now
# it's Sunday, 11:30 in the morning in London, then in the time zone with
# +14:00 offset people are already living in the "next day", Monday, because
# their time is 14 hours ahead of London.
# 
# Your task is stated as follows:
# 
# the reference time point is Tuesday, 10:30 in the morning in London
# (UTC+00:00)
# read the input string containing the number and the sign of this number (for
# example, +4, -10). Note, however, that there will be no sign if the number is
# 0. The number is always an integer.
# this number is the offset for some time zone.
# your program should calculate the day of the week in the time zone for which
# you were given the offset. The reference time point for your calculations is
# mentioned above.
# output the day of the week in the given time zone.
# 
# For example, if the input is -11, then, relatively to London, it's "the day
# before" in this time zone, that is, it's still Monday, but if the input is
# +3, then it's Tuesday, the same as in London.
# 
# The input format:
