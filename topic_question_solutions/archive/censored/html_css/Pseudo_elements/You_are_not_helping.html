    <h1>Pseudo-elements</h1>
    <p class="my_paragraph">The Almighty CSS allows you to not only work with
      elements declared in your HTML code but to also customize those parts of
      the page you can not address using simple selectors. This might be the
      customization of the first line of the paragraph, the first letter of the
      paragraph, or even the part of the text user has just selected.</p>
    <p>Here is the list of the most-used pseudo-elements:</p>
    <ul class="my_list">
      <li>::first-line</li>
      <li>::first-letter</li>
      <li>::placeholder</li>
      <li>::marker</li>
      <li>::before</li>
      <li>::after</li>
      <li>::selection</li>
    </ul>
