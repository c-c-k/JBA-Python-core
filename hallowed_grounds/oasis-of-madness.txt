You enter an ethereal desert, pieces of a puzzle are fleeting through the air, you get the impression that they would form the image of sky full of airplanes if the were assembled.
In the distance you see an oasis and start feeling an insatiable thirst.
You start walking towards the oasis mindlessly assembling the puzzle pieces fleeting by.
As you keep on going the oasis only seems to become more distant.
You forgo sleep you forgo food caring for nothing other than assembling the puzzle pieces you believe that you believe will bring the oasis closer by.
Somewhere in the back of your mind you understand that you are gripped by madness and that you will never reach the oasis because it is not for you..
.. but you can not stop...
